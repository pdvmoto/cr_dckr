# cr_dckr

Collect the files to create and maintain a cockraoch cluster.
noteably:
 notes.txt
 mk_cr_cly.sh: to create network, volumes, containers, and start them
 rm_cr_clu.sh: to stop + remove it - Careful!
 add files to start, to check etc.. 


also note: the pg sql files preferably into pg_scripts
but when things are too cr-specific, put them here..


comment:
I am of the opinion that "wire compatability" is No Compatability.
otherwise, CR seems a fairly mature product.
